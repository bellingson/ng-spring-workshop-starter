The starter contains two empty files: main.ts and person.ts.

1) In the person.ts file
	- create a class called Person 
	- add member variables id, name, and age; with appropriate types

2) In the main.ts file
	- import the Person class
	- create an instance of the Person
	- call the describe method
	
3) use the 'tsc' command to compile the typescript	
4) run the code using 'node main' command
